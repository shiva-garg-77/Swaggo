# Phase 3: Chat Functionality Fixes ðŸŽ¯

## Overview
Comprehensive fixes for chat messaging, room management, typing indicators, and notifications to ensure reliable real-time communication.

---

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Message Sending & Delivery Guarantees (#14-16)

**Current Problems:**
- Rate limiting may reject legitimate messages under high load
- Offline message queue lacks prioritization
- No conflict resolution for message sync
- Message reaction toggling causes excessive DB writes
- No deduplication for duplicate messages

**Solutions:**
- Implement intelligent rate limiting with burst allowance
- Add priority queue for offline messages
- Implement message deduplication by client message ID
- Batch message reactions to reduce DB writes
- Add idempotency keys for message operations

### 2. Room Joining & Permissions (#17)

**Current Problems:**
- Ad hoc room joining without batching
- Insufficient error feedback for failed joins
- Leave operations don't clear caches properly
- User role checks rely on outdated participant data

**Solutions:**
- Implement batch room joining with optimization
- Add detailed error responses with reasons
- Comprehensive cache clearing on leave
- Real-time participant permission validation

### 3. Typing Indicators & Notifications (#18-20)

**Current Problems:**
- Typing indicator timers don't clear correctly (stuck typing states)
- Notifications fire without filtering (overwhelming users)
- Message read receipts lack batching (excessive socket events)

**Solutions:**
- Auto-clear typing indicators with timeout
- Smart notification filtering based on user preferences
- Batch read receipts to reduce socket traffic
- Implement debouncing for typing events
