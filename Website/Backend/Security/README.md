# Backend Security Structure

This document outlines the organized structure for the Swaggo Backend Security components.

## Directory Structure

```

├── Testing/                # Security testing and vulnerability assessment
│   └── SecurityTestingCore.js  # Core security testing functionality
├── Orchestration/          # Security orchestration and automation
│   └── SecurityOrchestrationCore.js  # Core security orchestration functionality
├── Integration/            # Security integration with third-party services
│   └── SecurityIntegrationEnhancer.js  # Security integration enhancements
├── nginx/                  # Nginx security configuration
├── certs/                  # SSL/TLS certificates
├── mongo-init.js           # MongoDB initialization scripts
├── mongodb.conf            # MongoDB configuration
└── redis.conf              # Redis configuration
```

## Migration Plan

1. Security components from the root `Security/` directory have been moved to appropriate subdirectories
2. Configuration files remain in the root Security directory for easy access
3. Nginx, certificate, and database configuration files remain in their respective directories

This structure provides better organization and follows security best practices by categorizing security components by their function and purpose.
