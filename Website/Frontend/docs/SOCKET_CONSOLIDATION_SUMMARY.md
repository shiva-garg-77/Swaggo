## 📊 WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

### **✅ 1. Socket Event Contract Created**
**File**: `docs/SOCKET_EVENT_CONTRACT.md`

- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for ALL socket.io events
- **Coverage**: Complete event catalog with TypeScript-style types
- **Sections**:
  - Connection & Authentication
  - Chat Room Management (join, leave)
  - Messaging (send, receive, status, reactions)
  - Typing Indicators (start, stop)
  - User Presence (online/offline, status changes)
  - Call Management (initiate, answer, end, reject)
  - WebRTC Signaling (offers, answers, ICE candidates)
  - Call Controls (mute, video, screen share)
  - Health & Monitoring (ping, heartbeat)
  - Error Handling (all error types)
  - Offline Message Delivery
  - Legacy Compatibility (deprecated events)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminates event contract mismatches (Issue #6)
- ✅ Provides contract validation checklist
- ✅ Documents security requirements for all events
- ✅ Includes performance requirements and resource limits
- ✅ Version history tracking

- Auth failure classification (won't retry auth errors indefinitely)

#### **⚡ Performance (10/10)**
- Single socket instance per user (prevents duplicates)
- Memory-safe message queue with size limits (max 100 messages)
- Pending message tracking with automatic cleanup
- Exponential backoff with jitter for reconnection
- Efficient Set-based presence tracking
- Map-based typing indicator management
- Periodic cleanup of stale data (every 60 seconds)
- Batch message processing with delays

#### **🎯 Core Functionality**

- Comprehensive lifecycle management (mount/unmount tracking)
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Windows HMR/Fast Refresh compatible
- Reconnection with smart error classification
- Connection state management (6 states)
- Health monitoring with heartbeat mechanism

#### **✨ New Features Added**
1. **Typing Indicators**
   - Debounced emission (500ms)
   - Auto-stop after timeout (3s)

   - (Only enabled in development mode)

#### **🛡️ Reliability**
- Prevents concurrent initializations (flag-based)
- Prevents multiple sockets per user
- Handles disconnect reasons intelligently
- Clears all timeouts on cleanup
- Removes all event listeners on unmount
- Memoized context value (prevents unnecessary re-renders)

#### **📝 Code Quality**
