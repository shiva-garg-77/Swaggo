## 🔧 MANUAL TESTS (Test Page Actions)

### **Test 1: Send Test Message**
- [ ] Click "Send Test Message" button
- [ ] Verify message appears in test log as "sent successfully"
- [ ] Check backend logs for received message
- [ ] Verify callback receives `ack.success === true`
- [ ] Note the client message ID and server message ID

**Expected**: ✅ Message sent with both IDs returned

---

### **Test 2: Test Typing Indicator**
- [ ] Click "Test Typing" button
- [ ] Verify "Started typing" appears in log
- [ ] Wait 2 seconds
- [ ] Verify "Stopped typing" appears in log
- [ ] Check backend logs for typing events

**Expected**: ✅ Typing start and stop emitted

---

### **Test 3: Join Chat**
- [ ] Enter a valid chat ID in input
- [ ] Click "Join Chat" button
- [ ] Verify "Joined [chatid]" appears in log
- [ ] Check backend logs for join_chat event

**Expected**: ✅ Chat room joined successfully

---

### **Test 4: Test Reconnection**
- [ ] Note current connection status
- [ ] Click "Test Reconnect" button
- [ ] Verify "Reconnection triggered" in log
- [ ] Watch connection status change
- [ ] Verify reconnection completes

**Expected**: ✅ Manual reconnection works

---

## 🔍 SOCKET STATE VERIFICATION

Check the "Current Socket State" section:

- [ ] **Connection**: Shows 🟢 Connected (green)
- [ ] **Status**: Shows "connected" or "connecting"
- [ ] **Queue Size**: Should be 0 or low number
- [ ] **Pending**: Should be 0 or low number
- [ ] **Online Users**: Number ≥ 0
- [ ] **Typing Chats**: Number ≥ 0
- [ ] **Active Calls**: Number ≥ 0
- [ ] **Auth**: Shows ✅ Yes (green)

---

## 🎮 REAL-WORLD TESTS (Message Page)

Now test with the actual message page to ensure backward compatibility.

### **Setup: Navigate to Message Page**
```
http://localhost:3000/message
```

---

### **Test 5: Basic Messaging**
- [ ] Select a chat
- [ ] Send a test message
- [ ] Verify message appears immediately (optimistic update)
- [ ] Verify message status changes to "sent"
- [ ] Have another user send you a message
- [ ] Verify you receive the message in real-time

**Expected**: ✅ Messages work exactly as before

---

### **Test 6: Connection Stability**
- [ ] Keep message page open for 5 minutes
- [ ] Send messages periodically
- [ ] Check Developer Console for errors
- [ ] Verify no reconnection loops
- [ ] Check Chrome Task Manager for memory usage

**Expected**: 
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Memory stays stable (< 50MB growth)
- ✅ No infinite reconnections

---

### **Test 7: Soft Reload (HMR)**
- [ ] Make a small change to any frontend file
- [ ] Wait for Hot Module Replacement
- [ ] Verify socket reconnects automatically
- [ ] Verify no duplicate sockets created
- [ ] Check console logs for clean reconnection

**Expected**: ✅ Socket handles HMR gracefully

---

### **Test 8: Hard Reload (F5)**
- [ ] Press F5 to refresh page
- [ ] Wait for page to fully load
- [ ] Verify authentication persists
- [ ] Verify socket reconnects
- [ ] Verify previous chat still selected

**Expected**: ✅ Everything persists correctly

---

### **Test 9: Network Interruption**
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools > Network tab
- [ ] Click "Offline" to simulate network loss
- [ ] Wait 5 seconds
- [ ] Switch back to "Online"
- [ ] Verify socket reconnects automatically
- [ ] Verify exponential backoff (check console logs)

**Expected**: ✅ Smart reconnection with backoff

---

### **Test 10: Logout/Login**
- [ ] Logout from application
- [ ] Verify socket disconnects cleanly
- [ ] Login again
- [ ] Verify socket reconnects after auth
- [ ] Check for any cleanup errors in console

**Expected**: ✅ Clean disconnect and reconnect

---

## 🏥 HEALTH MONITORING

### **Browser Developer Console**
Check for these log patterns (development mode):

✅ **Good Signs**:
```
🔌 SOCKET: Initializing socket connection
✅ SOCKET: Connected to server
✅ SOCKET: Authentication successful
✅ SOCKET: Heartbeat monitoring started
```

❌ **Bad Signs**:
```
❌ SOCKET: Connection failed
⚠️ SOCKET: Initialization already in progress (multiple times)
❌ SOCKET: Authentication error
🔄 SOCKET: Reconnection attempt (excessive)
```

---

### **Memory Usage**

Use Chrome Task Manager (Shift + Esc):

| Metric | Acceptable | Warning | Critical |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| JavaScript Memory | < 50MB | 50-100MB | > 100MB |
| Memory Growth (5 min) | < 10MB | 10-50MB | > 50MB |
| Event Listeners | < 100 | 100-500 | > 500 |

---

### **Performance Metrics** (Dev Mode Only)

Check the metrics object in test page:

- [ ] `messagesQueued`: Should be 0 or low
- [ ] `messagesSent`: Should increment with each send
- [ ] `messagesReceived`: Should increment when receiving
- [ ] `reconnections`: Should be 0 or very low
- [ ] `lastHeartbeat`: Should update every 30 seconds
