   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Open the Visual Test Runner**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test-runner-browser.html
   ```

3. **Click "Run Full Test Suite"** and watch the beautiful interface test all 30 fixes!

4. **View Results**: See real-time progress, detailed results, and export capabilities.

### Method 2: 🖥️ **Console Test (Developer)**

1. **Navigate to your chat/message page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/message
   ```

2. **Open Browser Developer Console** (F12)

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### If tests fail to load:
1. Ensure your development server is running
2. Check that `debug-comprehensive-test.js` is in the `public/` folder
3. Verify browser JavaScript is enabled
4. Try refreshing the page and running again

### If many tests show as "FAIL":
1. Make sure you're on a page with authentication (like `/message`)
2. Ensure you're logged in to the application
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Try running tests after a fresh login

### If socket tests fail:
1. Verify your backend server is running
2. Check that socket.io is properly configured
3. Ensure you're authenticated in the application
4. Try refreshing and logging in again

## 🎯 **QUICK TEST COMMANDS:**

```javascript
// Quick health check
comprehensiveTest.testAuthContextInitialization()

// Test specific component  
comprehensiveTest.testSocketAuthentication()

// Get current auth state
console.log(window.debugAuth)

// Export results
copy(comprehensiveTest.results)

// Run all tests again
