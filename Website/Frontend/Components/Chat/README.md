## Best Practices

1. **Component Organization**: Components should be placed in the most appropriate subdirectory based on their primary functionality.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose.
3. **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different parts of the application.
4. **Documentation**: Each component should include JSDoc comments explaining its props and functionality.
5. **Testing**: Each component should have corresponding test files in the Tests directory.
