const socket = io('http://localhost:45799', {
  withCredentials: true,
  transports: ['websocket']
});
const start = Date.now();
socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connection time:', Date.now() - start, 'ms');
  socket.close();
  process.exit(0);
});
"
```

- [ ] Verify CORS headers present:
  - [ ] `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
  - [ ] `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`

#### 6.3 Authentication
- [ ] Try connecting without login
- [ ] Connection should be rejected
- [ ] Try with invalid token
- [ ] Connection should be rejected

---

### Step 7: Error Handling

#### 7.1 Network Errors
- [ ] Disconnect network
- [ ] Socket shows disconnected state
- [ ] Reconnect network
- [ ] Socket reconnects automatically

#### 7.2 Server Restart
- [ ] Stop backend server
- [ ] Frontend shows disconnected
- [ ] Start backend server
- [ ] Frontend reconnects automatically

#### 7.3 Invalid Credentials
- [ ] Clear cookies
- [ ] Try to connect
- [ ] Connection rejected with clear error message

---

### Step 8: Load Testing (Optional)

#### 8.1 Multiple Connections
- [ ] Open 5 browser tabs
- [ ] Login in each tab
- [ ] All tabs connect successfully
- [ ] Send messages from different tabs
- [ ] All messages delivered correctly

#### 8.2 Rapid Messages
- [ ] Send 50 messages rapidly
- [ ] All messages delivered
- [ ] No rate limiting errors (unless expected)
