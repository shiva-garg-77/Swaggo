## QUICK TEST (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Refresh Both Browser Windows
- **User A** (shivahumaiyaar): Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **User B** (shiva): Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Step 2: Check Connection Status
**Both users should see**:
- âœ… "Socket connected" in browser console
- âœ… "Joined chat room: [chatid]" in browser console
- âœ… "âœ… Successfully joined chat room" in browser console

**Backend should show**:
- âœ… Two socket connections
- âœ… Both users joined the same chat room

### Step 3: Send Test Messages
**User A sends**: "Hello from User A"
- âœ… Message appears in User A's chat (sender side)
- âœ… Message appears in User B's chat (receiver side)
- âœ… Backend logs show: `ðŸ“¤ Broadcasting message_received to room`

**User B sends**: "Hello back from User B"
- âœ… Message appears in User B's chat (sender side)
- âœ… Message appears in User A's chat (receiver side)
- âœ… Backend logs show: `ðŸ“¤ Broadcasting message_received to room`

### Step 4: Test Typing Indicators
**User A starts typing**:
- âœ… User B sees "User is typing..."
- âœ… Indicator disappears after User A stops typing

**User B starts typing**:
- âœ… User A sees "User is typing..."
- âœ… Indicator disappears after User B stops typing

## COMPREHENSIVE TEST (15 minutes)

### Test 1: Message Delivery âœ…
1. User A sends 5 messages rapidly
2. All 5 messages appear in User B's chat
3. No duplicate messages
4. Messages appear in correct order
5. All messages have correct sender name

**Expected Result**: All messages delivered correctly

---

### Test 2: Connection Resilience âœ…
1. User B closes browser tab
2. User A sends 3 messages while User B is offline
3. User B reopens browser and logs in
4. User B should receive all 3 offline messages

**Expected Result**: Offline messages delivered on reconnection

---

### Test 3: Error Handling âœ…
1. User A sends a message
2. Backend processes it
3. If backend returns error, User A sees error message
4. Failed message shows "failed" status
5. User can retry sending

**Expected Result**: Errors handled gracefully with user feedback

---

### Test 4: Room Join Confirmation âœ…
1. User A opens chat
2. Browser console shows: "âœ… Successfully joined chat room"
3. Backend confirms room join

**Expected Result**: Room join confirmed on both sides

---

### Test 5: Typing Indicator Cleanup âœ…
1. User A starts typing
2. User A stops typing
3. Wait 3 seconds
4. Typing indicator disappears for User B
5. No memory leaks (check browser memory)

**Expected Result**: Typing indicator cleaned up properly

---

### Test 6: Connection State Monitoring âœ…
1. User A is connected
2. Stop backend server
3. User A sees "disconnected" state
4. Start backend server
5. User A automatically reconnects
6. User A rejoins chat room

**Expected Result**: Connection state tracked and auto-reconnect works

---

### Test 7: Message Validation âœ…
1. Backend sends malformed message (missing fields)
2. Frontend validates and rejects it
3. Error logged in console
4. No crash

**Expected Result**: Invalid messages rejected gracefully

---

### Test 8: Duplicate Message Prevention âœ…
1. User A sends message
2. Backend broadcasts it
3. Same message arrives twice (network issue)
4. Frontend shows message only once

**Expected Result**: Duplicates prevented

---

### Test 9: Acknowledgment Handling âœ…
1. User A sends message
2. Backend responds with success
3. Message status updates to "sent"
4. If backend responds with error
5. Message status updates to "failed"
6. User sees error alert

**Expected Result**: Acknowledgments handled correctly

---

### Test 10: Memory Leak Test âœ…
1. Open chat
2. Send 100 messages
3. Close chat
4. Open different chat
5. Repeat 10 times
6. Check browser memory usage

**Expected Result**: No memory leaks, stable memory usage
